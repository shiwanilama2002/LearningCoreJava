I have gained foundational knowledge in Java programming, covering essential concepts such as:

Java Basics:
Understanding the structure of a Java program, syntax, and basic operations.
Familiarity with variables, constants, and data types.
Data Types:
Learned about primitive data types (int, float, char, boolean, etc.) and non-primitive types (arrays, objects).
Understanding type conversion and casting.
Conditional Statements:
Implementation of control flow using if-else, switch-case, and nested conditions.
Practical applications in decision-making scenarios.
Loops:
Mastered iteration techniques using for, while, and do-while loops.
Application of loops in various problem-solving contexts.
Functions (Methods):
Gained insights into defining and invoking functions.
Understanding method parameters, return types, and scope of variables.
Method Overloading:
Explored the concept of defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
Practical use cases of method overloading for flexibility and code reusability.
Arrays:
Understanding single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
Performing operations such as traversal, insertion, and deletion of elements.
Object and Class:
Learned the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), focusing on objects and classes.
Creation of objects, constructors, and understanding instance vs. class variables.
